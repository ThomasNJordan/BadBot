# Month of Malware 
## About
This project is a collection of the code I wrote while learning windows malware development. Starting from knowing nothing about malware development, windows internals, or creating red team infrastructure; I ended up creating a piece of malware that can be used as a RAT, Ransomware, and even as a botnet. Each module covers a topic, and contains documented code snippets intended to help people who want a hands-on learning experience.
