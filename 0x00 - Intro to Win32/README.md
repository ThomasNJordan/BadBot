# 0x00 - Day 1, Hello World
Malware Development is a very, very complex field with a lot of technical topics I need to learn. So I thought I'd start small by learning the Win32 API. This API is how developers can write C++ programs on Windows. It's no longer used as much in favor of .NET development, but it's very useful for Malware Development since it gives more control over the memory of the system, has less overhead, and less abstraction. This makes our code more portable, less likely to be detected by Antivirus, and much smaller in size. 

Today I started by just reading the documentation and following Microsoft's recommended first steps: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/learn-to-program-for-windows
