# 16 - Command and Control - Advanced Features
This is the C2 server I will use to communicate with my ransomware. The C2 server, as well as the command line interface for it are both written in python. I have included a test client that will be translated into C/C++ for the windows client. 

Features:
- Multiple Client Handeling
- System Telemetry
- Individual file encryption
- Key management
- Ransoming and restoring a system
