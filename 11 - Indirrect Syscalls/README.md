# 11 - Indirect Syscalls
This is the second exercise where I am following Crow's and Read Ops' blogs on Indirrect Syscall Injection. None of the code is original, but re-written while following the blog post. I'll attempt my own implementation of a indirrect syscall using SysWhisper on Windows 11 in the next exercise.
