# 17 - Putting It All Together

This is the last chapter in my Learning Malware project. From knowing nothing about malware development, I have created undetectable ransomware (as of April 2024),  created my own infrastructure  and C2, and leanred many interseting anti-foresnics techniques to look out for when  reverse engineering. 

Files:
- C2 Server
  - c2.py -> handles C2 logic (runs as a background process)
  - cli.py -> to interface with the C2
- Ransomware
