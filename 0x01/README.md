# 0x02 - Week 2, Process Management
This week I started to get very familiar with the way the Win32 library worked. The function declaration and syntax had a small learning curve, but once I got my head around all the terminology - I got the hang of it pretty quick. This week I focused on interacting with processes, creating new ones, enumerating all information about them, and learning about the roles of handlers and threads. This is all in preparation for next week when I begin learning process injection (and eventually DLL injection).
