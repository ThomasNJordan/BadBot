# 0x01 - Day 2, Process Management
Today I started to get very familiar with the way the Win32 library worked. The function declaration and syntax had a small learning curve, but once I got my head around all the terminology - I got the hang of it pretty quick. I focused on interacting with processes, creating new ones, enumerating all information about them, and learning about the roles of handlers and threads. This is all in preparation for tomorrow when I begin learning process injection (and eventually DLL injection).
